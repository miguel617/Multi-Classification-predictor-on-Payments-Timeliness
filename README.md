# Multi-Classification-predictor-on-Payments-Timeliness


The objective of this task is to build a predictor that informs whether a payment occurs ahead of time, on time or if it's delayed, given an input data containing transactional and master data.

A payment is considered to be on time if it occurs within the same month of the due date.

To tackle this problem we will do the following steps:

- Data Exploration and Analysis
- Feature  and Data Transformation
- Forecasting models using ML classification algoritms - Supervised methods to build a predictor
